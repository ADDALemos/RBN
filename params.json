For steady state, please consider the synchronous where the time-series have only two columns with the same values.\r\n\r\n### Available repair operations:\r\n\r\n* Repair e - removes regulator\r\n* Repair i - negates a regulator\r\n* Repair g - changes AND function to OR function\r\nNote: All the combinations of repairs are allowed, and they need to be written in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n### Model\r\n\r\nThe model has to be encoded in Boolsim ([format](http://www.colomoto.org/formats/boolsim.html)). \r\n\r\n### Experimental values\r\n\r\nThe program can deal with 0 or more observations. The observations correspond to a time-series and the time-series is organized in a matrix. As this argument is optional when not present the program will infer the data to minimize the number of repair operations needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n# Dependencies\r\nAn ASP solver (contained in the source folder) and available at:\r\n\r\n[clingo](https://github.com/potassco/clingo)\r\n\r\nUses the Quince McCluskey algorithm available at:\r\n\r\n[Quine-McCluskey](https://github.com/pfpacket/Quine-McCluskey) (to compile requires the Boost C++ Libraries [boost.org](http://www.boost.org/)\r\n\r\n***\r\n## Data Sets\r\n### Steady State\r\nIn the folder examples/steady two data sets originaly obtained from  are available.\r\nAs the model did not have functions associated with them, all nodes are explained by the same function, where a biological component is present if it has at least one activator and has no inbitors.\r\n### Time-series\r\nThe data sets in the folder examples/time were randomly genereted using the program available on the folder scripts. The model was generated using the script available at [BoolNetR2GINsim](https://github.com/ptgm/BoolNetR2GINsim).\r\n***\r\n# Authors\r\nAlexandre Lemos, [Pedro T.
